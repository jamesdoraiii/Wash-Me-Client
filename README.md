WashMe is the premier peer to peer automotive detailing service. Get in touch with detailers in your area or promote your own detailing services and earn some cash! Getting your car detailed is easier than ever with WashMe. 

WashMe was created with Angular 7 and nodeJS. Using Angular Material for the styling and structure of this app, the overall look of the app has a motorsport feel.  The backend has 4 tables consisting of users, detailers, contacts and reviews. In order to access the app itself, you must create a user in order to browse the detailers in your area. If the user decides to be a detailer for WashMe, the user will then set up a detailer profile. Users can contact detailers through email. When on the detailer’s profile, the user can click on the “contact” button to open Outlook on their machine. If the user wanted to see examples of the detailer’s work, there is a yellow button on the detailer profile page that will open a new page to the detailer’s Imgur album of  “before-and-after” pictures of cars they have detailed.  Users can write reviews about detailers. Users can only delete the reviews they have made. The admin users can delete any reviews made by any user.  This app is deployed to heroku.
